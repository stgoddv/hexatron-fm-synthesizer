### Motivation


### Features


1. 6 mapeable FM operators that can be modulated in any way possible by means of a modulation matrix.
2. Each modulator has it's own: Amplitude envelope, Waveform, Frequency coarse and fine adjustment, Modulation index and optional perlin noise addition. You can also fix frequencies for specifics operators.
3. Each amplitude envelope can be looped independently, making complex nonlinear sound textures. Each envelope has it's own duration also.
4. Tons of predefined waveforms: Sine, Square, Triangle, Random, White and Pink Noise and Custom.
5. The custom waveform can be done selecting each harmonic individually. You can choose between 16, 32 or 64 harmonics.
6. Global parameters: pitch transposition, panning, global time strech for envelopes, tone.
7. You can save and load presets. Also there's a little keyboard integrated for rapid tests.

This is a project that I have done completely in my free time. If you think you could fix some issue or improve some functionality, I would be glad to receive PRs.
